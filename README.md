Examples of C# and HLSL code for use in the Unity3D engine. They are offered here under the MIT license, however note that these are not complete projects. This code is meant only to demonstrate how I solved various problems in the past, not act as releases in and of themselves. Having said that - if you can find use for any of the code herein - by all means do with it as you will.
